When putting this into a Google Apps Script project, make sure to go to "Project Settings" and then click "Script Properties" and add a property, the key being "OPENAI_KEY" and then the value being the OpenAI key itself. A better explanation is:

Under Project Settings, click Script Properties and add a property:

Key: OPENAI_KEY

Value: your sk‑… key

P.S: Don't add this into the Google Apps Scripts files, this is just for steps/a better explanation.

IF YOU'RE USING THIS VIA REPLIT:
